# ⚡ Chapter: Electric Charges and Fields

## 1. Electric Charge
Definition: Property of matter due to which it experiences an electric force in an electric field.
Types of Charges:
- Positive charge → deficiency of electrons
- Negative charge → excess of electrons
Unit: Coulomb (C)
1 C = 6.25 × 10¹⁸ electrons

### Properties of Electric Charge
1. Additivity: Total charge is the algebraic sum of individual charges.
2. Conservation: Total charge of an isolated system remains constant.
3. Quantization: Charge exists in integral multiples of elementary charge.
q = n × e, where e = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C and n is an integer.

## 2. Coulomb’s Law
It gives the electrostatic force between two stationary point charges.
F = (1 / 4πε₀) × (q₁q₂ / r²)
where,
F = electrostatic force,
q₁, q₂ = charges,
r = distance between charges,
ε₀ = permittivity of free space = 8.854 × 10⁻¹² C²/N·m²
In a medium of permittivity ε:
F = (1 / 4πε) × (q₁q₂ / r²)
Nature:
- Attractive for opposite charges
- Repulsive for like charges

## 3. Vector Form of Coulomb’s Law
→F₁₂ = (1 / 4πε₀) × (q₁q₂ / r³) →r₂₁
where →r₂₁ is the position vector of charge 2 with respect to charge 1.

## 4. Principle of Superposition
Net electric force on any charge is the vector sum of forces due to all other charges.
→F = Σ →Fᵢ

---

## 5. Electric Field
Definition: Region around a charge where another charge experiences a force.
Electric Field Intensity (E):
→E = →F / q₀
where q₀ is a small positive test charge.
Unit: N/C or V/m
For a Point Charge:
→E = (1 / 4πε₀) × (q / r²) →r̂

## 6. Electric Field Lines
Definition: Imaginary lines that represent the direction of the electric field.
Properties:
1. Originate from positive charge and terminate on negative charge.
2. Never intersect.
3. Tangent at any point gives the field direction.
4. Density of lines ∝ magnitude of the field.
5. Lines are perpendicular to the surface of a conductor.

## 7. Electric Field due to a System of Charges
Using the superposition principle:
→E = Σ (1 / 4πε₀) × (qᵢ / rᵢ²) →r̂ᵢ

---

## 8. Electric Dipole
Definition: Two equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance.
Dipole moment (→p) = q × 2l → (from - to +)
Unit: C·m (Vector quantity)

### Electric Field due to a Dipole
At axial point:
E = (1 / 4πε₀) × (2p / r³)
At equatorial point:
E = (1 / 4πε₀) × (p / r³)

### Torque on a Dipole in Uniform Electric Field:
τ = pE sinθ

---

## 9. Electric Flux (Φ)
Definition: The total number of electric field lines passing through a surface.
Φ = →E · →A = EA cosθ
Unit: N·m²/C

---

## 10. Gauss’s Law
Statement: The total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to 1/ε₀ times the total charge enclosed by the surface.
Φ = ∮ →E · →dA = q_enclosed / ε₀

### Applications:
1. Electric field due to an infinite line charge:
   E = λ / (2πε₀r)
2. Electric field due to an infinite plane sheet:
   E = σ / (2ε₀)
3. Electric field due to a uniformly charged sphere:
   - Outside (r > R): E = (1 / 4πε₀) × (Q / r²)
   - On Surface (r = R): E = (1 / 4πε₀) × (Q / R²)
   - Inside (r < R): E = (1 / 4πε₀) × (Q × r / R³)

---

## 11. Conductors and Insulators
Conductors: Materials that allow charge flow (metals)
Insulators: Materials that resist charge flow (rubber, glass)

Properties of Conductors:
1. Electric field inside conductor = 0
2. Charge resides on surface only
3. Surface is an equipotential surface
4. Normal component of →E just outside = σ / ε₀

---

## 12. Electrostatic Shielding
Phenomenon where the electric field inside a conductor cavity is zero, even if an external field is present.
Used to protect sensitive instruments from external electric fields.

---

## 13. Key Constants
ε₀ = 8.854 × 10⁻¹² C²/N·m²
k = 1 / (4πε₀) = 9 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²
e = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C

## 14. Important Formulas Summary
| Quantity | Symbol | Formula | Unit |
|-----------|---------|----------|------|
| Electric Force | F | (1 / 4πε₀)(q₁q₂ / r²) | N |
| Electric Field | E | F / q | N/C |
| Dipole Moment | p | q × 2l | C·m |
| Electric Flux | Φ | E·A | N·m²/C |
| Torque on Dipole | τ | pE sinθ | N·m |

## 15. Conceptual Notes
- Electric field is vector, charge is scalar.
- Electric lines never form closed loops (start +, end –).
- Inside a conductor, E = 0, potential = constant.
- For spherical symmetry, use Gauss’s law.
- Dipole field ∝ 1/r³, monopole field ∝ 1/r².
