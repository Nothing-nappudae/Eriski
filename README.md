# üß† Eriski ‚Äî My Physics AI Assistant

Eriski started as a random midnight idea ‚Äî  
I just wanted an AI that could actually *read my own physics notes* instead of throwing random textbook answers at me.  

So I built one.

Eriski is a **local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** bot that reads my notes, indexes them, and answers my physics questions directly from what I‚Äôve studied.  
No cloud, no external API ‚Äî just me, my PC, and my messy notes.

# ‚öôÔ∏è What It Does
- Reads `.txt`, `.md`, and `.pdf` notes from a `notes/` folder  
- Breaks them into small chunks and stores them in a local database  
- Uses **Ollama (Llama 3.1)** + **LangChain** + **ChromaDB**  
- Lets me chat with my own notes through the terminal  
- Works 100% offline üßæ

#  Why I Made It:
I was tired of flipping through old notebooks before every physics test.  
I wanted something that understood my explanations, my way of writing, and my confusion points.  
Eriski became that ‚Äî a little assistant that speaks *my version* of physics.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
- **Python**
- **Ollama** for local LLMs (Llama 3.1)
- **LangChain** for RAG pipeline
- **ChromaDB** for vector search
- **FAISS embeddings** via `nomic-embed-text`
